# Schematic Project Overview

## Summary
Schematic is a schema management tool designed to handle database schema migrations efficiently. It leverages Alembic for version control and supports multiple databases, including StarRocks and PostgreSQL. The project aims to provide a robust solution for managing DDL changes, integrating with DBT models, and orchestrating workflows using Dagster.

## Key Features
- Schema Version Control: Utilize Alembic for managing schema changes with rollback capabilities.
- Multi-Database Support: Support for StarRocks (MySQL protocol) and PostgreSQL.
- Integration with DBT: Validate and manage dependencies between schema changes and DBT models.
- Workflow Orchestration: Use Dagster for scheduling and orchestrating data pipelines.
- Dockerization: Provide a minimal Docker image for easy deployment and execution.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Features

#### Setup Alembic:
- Configure Alembic for schema migrations.
- Implement basic migration scripts for StarRocks and PostgreSQL.

#### Dockerization:
- Create a minimal Docker image with Alembic and necessary dependencies.
- Ensure support for both StarRocks and PostgreSQL.

#### Basic CLI:
- Develop a command-line interface for executing migrations.
- Support environment-specific configurations.

### Phase 2: Integration and Extensions

#### DBT Integration:
- Implement validation logic to ensure DBT models are compatible with schema changes.
- Develop interfaces for managing dependencies between schema and DBT models.

#### Dagster Orchestration:
- Set up Dagster for orchestrating schema migrations and DBT model executions.
- Implement basic scheduling and monitoring capabilities.

#### Custom Operations:
- Extend Alembic with custom operations for complex DDL tasks.
- Provide hooks for pre- and post-migration validation.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Optimization

#### Enhanced Scheduling:
- Develop advanced scheduling features in Dagster for complex workflows.
- Implement dynamic scheduling and dependency management.

#### State Management:
- Optimize state management for large-scale deployments.
- Implement distributed state synchronization if needed.

#### Monitoring and Alerts:
- Integrate monitoring tools for real-time tracking of migrations and workflows.
- Develop custom alerting mechanisms for failure scenarios.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

#### Comprehensive Testing:
- Develop unit and integration tests for all components.
- Ensure compatibility across different database versions and environments.

#### Documentation and Training:
- Create detailed documentation for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
- Provide training materials for end-users and developers.

#### Deployment Strategy:
- Develop a deployment strategy for production environments.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Ensure all core features are implemented and working as expected.
- Performance: Optimize for speed and resource usage, especially in large-scale environments.
- Scalability: Ensure the system can handle increasing loads and complex workflows.
- Usability: Provide a user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation.
- Reliability: Ensure robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
