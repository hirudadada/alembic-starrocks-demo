# Schematic Project Evaluation Report

## 1. Technical Architecture Assessment

### Core Components

#### Schema Management (Alembic)
- ✅ Robust version control for database schemas
- ✅ Support for raw SQL and SQLAlchemy operations 
- ✅ Built-in rollback capabilities
- ⚠️ Need custom implementation for StarRocks support

#### Integration Capabilities

##### DBT Integration
- ✅ Clear dependency management
- ✅ Schema validation for models
- ⚠️ Potential complexity in maintaining synchronization

##### Dagster Orchestration
- ✅ Unified deployment pipeline
- ✅ Scheduling and monitoring capabilities
- ⚠️ Limitations in complex scheduling scenarios

## 2. Development Efficiency Analysis

### Resource Optimization

#### Development Time
- Leveraging existing tools (Alembic, DBT)
- Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure
- Reduced boilerplate code

#### Maintenance Effort
- Community-supported core components
- Well-documented systems
- Established best practices

### Risk Assessment

```
| Component        | Risk Level | Mitigation                      |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Schema Migration | Low        | Alembic's proven track record  |
| StarRocks Support| Medium     | Custom implementation needed   |
| Integration      | Medium     | Clear interface definitions    |
| Scaling         | Low        | Built-in distributed support   |
```
