# Alembic vs Yoyo-migrations for StarRocks

## Key Differences

### 1. Architecture & Design

**Alembic**:
- SQLAlchemy-based, more structured approach
- Supports complex migration dependencies
- Version tracking through dedicated version tables
- Better integration with SQLAlchemy ORM (ËôΩÁÑ∂Âú® StarRocks Âú∫ÊôØ‰∏çÂ§™Áõ∏ÂÖ≥)

**Yoyo**:
- Lightweight, simpler architecture
- Flat migration structure
- Simple version tracking
- Direct SQL execution focused

### 2. Migration Management

**Alembic**:
```python
# Alembic - Structured with upgrade/downgrade
def upgrade() -> None:
    op.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE demo.test (
            id INT NOT NULL,
            name VARCHAR(255)
        ) ENGINE = OLAP 
        DUPLICATE KEY(id)
    ''')

def downgrade() -> None:
    op.execute('DROP TABLE demo.test')
```

**Yoyo**:
```python
# Yoyo - Direct SQL with steps
steps = [
    step('''
        CREATE TABLE demo.test (
            id INT NOT NULL,
            name VARCHAR(255)
        ) ENGINE = OLAP 
        DUPLICATE KEY(id)
    ''',
    'DROP TABLE demo.test')
]
```

### 3. Features Comparison

| Feature | Alembic | Yoyo |
|---------|---------|------|
| Migration Dependencies | ‚úÖ Complex dependency chains | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic ordering |
| Auto-generation | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚ùå Not supported |
| Transaction Support | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Basic |
| Branching | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚ùå Limited |
| StarRocks Native Support | ‚úÖ Coming soon | ‚ùå No plans |
| Learning Curve | üî∏ Steeper | üîπ Simpler |

### 4. StarRocks Specific Considerations

**Alembic Advantages**:
- Better handling of StarRocks' complex DDL
- Native StarRocks support in development
- Better integration with enterprise workflows
- More robust version control

**Yoyo Advantages**:
- Simpler setup for basic migrations
- Lighter weight
- Easier to learn
- Good for small projects

## Recommendation

### Choose Alembic when you need:
- Complex migration dependencies
- Enterprise-grade version control
- Future StarRocks native support
- Team collaboration features
- Integration with larger systems

### Choose Yoyo when you need:
- Simple migration scripts
- Quick setup
- Single developer workflow
- Basic version control
- Minimal dependencies
